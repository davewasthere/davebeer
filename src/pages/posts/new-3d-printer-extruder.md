My daughter and I were trying to do a few little experiments one day, one of which needed a 3d print. So cranked up the old Crealty CR6-SE and started printing. The feed wasn't working though, and when I pull on the lever the entire cover just broke into multiple pieces.

 So I had to figure out what that part was, and how to replace it, and with what. Fortunately, it's a common problem and there are a lot of solutions. I ended up going with the metal extruder from [Creality3D](https://www.amazon.com.au/Comgrow-Creality-Extruder-Feeder-Aluminum/dp/B0831FZDCT) which is a direct replacement for the original plastic one. The only thing I wasn't sure about was whether it was for my printer or not, as it only said it was for the Ender 3/Pro and CR-10. But it turns out it's the same extruder, just with a different name.

The new extruder is just awesome. Beautifully engineered, and so much easier to feed through. And it's might just be me, but it seems to print a lot better too.

So yeah, success.
