Sometimes you think the end is in sight. It's so close it's almost tangible. But that's when you're likely to get caught out.

Once, I was returning from a mission. Just training, but we'd 'killed' the enemy and were returning home. But only a few kilometers from base we were ambushed by enemy forces and were killed ourselves.

We'd let ourselves think we were home free. The end was in sight and we'd let our guard down. That lesson has stuck home for the last 20 years.

I'm on the home straight, but it ain't over 'til the fat lady sings.

And even then, I'll be careful.
