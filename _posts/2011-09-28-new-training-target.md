title: I've got a new training target
description: It's always good to have something to aim for...

Having done my first triathlon a couple of weeks ago, I need a new target to aim for. Fortunately I got a skype message from my Uncle yesterday. He's doing the [Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge](http://www.cyclechallenge.com) and has a spare bike. So that gives me my new target.

Can't say I've ever ridden that sort of distance before. So going to have to start getting some miles in. 

Also going to miss the gym as my membership ends at the end of this month. Really been enjoying the weights. I'm doing the [Stronglifts 5x5 program](http://www.stronglifts.com), but will have to replace it with bodyweight exercises now that I'll be travelling.
