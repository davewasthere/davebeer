title: If you seek tranquillity, do less
description: I ruminate on what is and isn't necessary after reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

I'm reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and really enjoying it. But one bit has struck me as particularly thought provoking.

He wrote:

> Because of most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, "Is this necessary?"

And that's got me thinking...

Is this necessary?
