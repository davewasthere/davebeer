title: Climbing out of that pit

It's funny how bad you can let someone else make you feel. There's no real reason for it. Why should someone else's behaviour have an effect on me?

But for the past couple of months, I've let that happen. Someone who I thought was a friend treated me horribly and I found it incredibly difficult to deal with.

NLP (Neuro-linguistic programming) has been a big help. One technique is reframing. Where you look at remembered events from a different point of view. The bonus there is you can lessen the negative emotional impact of a memory (or strengthen positive ones). It doesn't make the emotions go away, but it does help bring them down to manageable levels.

At some point I seem to have lost the ability to do this naturally. In the past, when negative things have happened, I think I've normally been able to see the silver lining quite easily. But this recent low hit harder than I'd expected and for a while I couldn't see a way out.

But I'm beginning to see the positives again. Life is wonderful and full of opportunities and surprises.

Magic!
