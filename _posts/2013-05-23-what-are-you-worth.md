It's astounding how many people think their only option to earn money is to get a job. It's not a given that you have to work for an employer.

That said, jobs are great for the sheeple. What you wear, where you work, taxes, working hours... all sorts of decisions are taken care of for you. All you have to do is rock up and hand over 8 hours of your life each day. In return for your irreplaceable time, the company will give you back a portion of the value you've created for them.

But that begs the question. If you're worth enough to earn $XX at company Y, then why can't you work for yourself and earn something comparable? Think of all the dead-weight at companies you've worked at in the past. How much better would it be if you didn't have to carry them?
