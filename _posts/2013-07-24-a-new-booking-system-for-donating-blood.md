I'm a blood donor when I'm allowed. I seem to travel to malarial regions enough that the 6 month waiting period limits how often I can donate. But each time I'm able, and I try to book online, it's that damn booking engine that puts me off for the most part.

Searching on blood.co.uk for your local donation center is great. It's the step after clicking the book button that I take issue with.

The first question is: Are you an enrolled blood donor?

If you answer no, then it asks if you'd like to enrol and gives you a form to fill out. But if you answer yes, it pretty much gives you the same form. Why?

Check it out:

Anyway, that's only the half of it. The other down side, is appointments have to be manually entered. You give them a possible two times that you'd like, and they'll maybe give you one of those times, or something near it. I'm sure we can do better than that.

Surely it could be boiled down to:

Enter Donor Number, get presented with a list of available appointment slots, pick one, enter email for reminder notifications and you're done.
