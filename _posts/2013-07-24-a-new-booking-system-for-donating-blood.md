title: A new booking system for donating blood
description: "I'd like to build blood.co.uk a new booking system. Their current one adds too much friction to the process"

I'm a blood donor when I'm allowed. I seem to travel to Malarial regions enough that the 6 month waiting period limits how often I can donate. But each time I would like to book, it's that damn booking engine that puts me off for the most part.

Searching on blood.co.uk for your local donation center is great.
