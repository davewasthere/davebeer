I don't often bid for work. In the past, I've normally been approached to work on a project by someone who either knows me, has worked with me, or has had some sort of recommendation. So it was a unique experience to write a proposal for a client who I believe wants a fixed price quote.

For one thing, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/09/development-is-inherently-wicked.html" rel="nofollow">Software is a Wicked Problem</a>. In my early years of software development, I'd spent time doing traditional big design up front in an attempt to 'nail down the requirements'. I can say now, with hindsight, that that just doesn't work.

But I can understand the desire to know exactly how much something will cost, even if it's not clear exactly what it is I'll be building.

The solution, I hope, is a matter of education. Emphasising that there will be regular releases (I release weekly as a minimum) and incredible visibility into progress means that very quickly it'll be possible to measure planned vs actual business benefits.
