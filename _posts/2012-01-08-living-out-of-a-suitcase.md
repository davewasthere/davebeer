title: Living out of a suitcase
---
I'm about six weeks into my Summer down under. Been wandering around a little, catching up with family and friends, enjoying Christmas and seeing the New Year in. Now I'm about to head down to Wellington for a spot of networking and seeing more friends down there.

But I've noticed something about this wandering lifestyle. I'm effectively living out of a suitcase. I've got a few changes of clothes, my laptop, kindle, four cameras (a little excessive..), golf clubs and my little ipod shuffle... And you know what? I don't really miss all of my 'stuff' back in the UK.

Sure, a desk and some big monitors makes programming, or just using the computer, a nicer easier experience. But it's definitely not essential. Perhaps the main thing I miss is my bed, but you can get used to sleeping wherever you can after a while.

So one thing I'm hoping, is that living this minimalist existence for the next few months makes it easier to get rid of all my stuff when I return to the UK. I've been weighed down by too much crap for too long. Time to boil it down to the essentials, lightening the load. Otherwise, all that stuff just ends up owning you.
