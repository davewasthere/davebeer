I'm finding it a bit irritating getting a page build error in my blog. I suspect Prose.io is acting up possibly, but github isn't really helping by giving the rather generic error 'page build failed'. That really doesn't tell me much.

Problem is, running windows, it's pretty difficult to get an installation of Ruby, the dev tools, the Jekyll gem and all that running properly. It's possible, I'm sure, but not really supported.

I actually have a lot of fun developing for windows. I like Visual Studio 2012 and MVC4. The toolset just keeps getting better and more pleasurable to work with. But there are times that I sorely consider switching to Ubuntu and developing solely in Linux. Probably single page web-apps with a ruby on rails backend... but it's seriously going to feel like starting from scratch.
