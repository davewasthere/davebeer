title: Mindfulness and why I've not yet gotten a smartphone
---
I'm still wandering around with just my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_W810" rel="nofollow">Sony Ericsson W810i</a> for a phone. I get a little bit of stick from friends who possibly don't get why I've not yet 'upgraded' to a smartphone considering how much of a geek I can be in other areas.

I've lost track of the number of times I've seen a group of friends sitting together somewhere, and every single one of them is playing on their phone. If they're on facebook, then they need a kick up their bum. **Your mates are right there with you!**

Thing is, I've got maps, internet, a camera, music etc.. on my phone. The interface isn't as slick, but my battery tends to last about a week. It's also a pretty good phone when all is said and done. I'm not sure you can say that about some of the iPhone models. And I've been rather underwhelmed with the quality of the photos the camera takes.

But crucially, I just don't need a smart phone. Sure, it'd make certain things easier, but I'm pretty bored of the internets these days. I'd rather be here in the real world. Now if I could just go the next step and actually get rid of the mobile!
